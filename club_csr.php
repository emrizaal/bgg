      <p class="tjus">A centre of hope, sharing and growth that caters to the needs of children, young people and senior citizens, regardless of race or creed. In these times of haste, stress and pressure, we have created Ti-Ratana to be a sanctuary, a centre of hope for the hopeless and the helpless, a place of rest for the infirm or the healthy, a place to learn and grow, love, share or just be.The total money raised amounted to more than RM530,000 this year compared with RM415,000 previously in this annual charity golf game in aid of the society. A buffet dinner-cum-cheque presentation ceremony was held at the Ti Chen Chinese Restaurant at the Saujana Golf and Country Club after players had their round of play at the golf course earlier in the afternoon. Organising committee co-chairman Tan Chuan Yong said from the total of RM530,000, more than RM200,000 were through fees of flights by the players and also through sponsorship of the souvenir programme book.</p>
